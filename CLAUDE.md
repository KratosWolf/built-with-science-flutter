# Built With Science App - Development Log

## 🏋️ Project Overview

Science-based Flutter workout tracking app with intelligent progression, offline capabilities, and cloud sync via Supabase.

## 🚀 Session Accomplishments (August 23, 2025)

### ✅ Complete Authentication System Implementation
- **AuthScreen**: Full login/signup with email/password + anonymous guest mode
- **AuthWrapper**: Authentication state management and automatic routing
- **ProfileScreen**: User settings, workout stats, and account management
- **Form validation** with proper error handling and loading states
- **Real-time auth state** management with Supabase listeners

### ✅ Supabase Integration Foundation
- **New Supabase project** created: `built-with-science-app`
  - URL: `https://gktvfldykmzhynqthbdn.supabase.co`
  - Configured with proper credentials in Flutter app
- **Complete database schema** designed (`supabase_schema.sql`):
  - User profiles with preferences (unit, progression style, video preference)
  - Programs and program days structure
  - Exercises with variations and YouTube URLs
  - Workout sessions and sets tracking
  - Last set cache for intelligent progression
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection
- **Seed data script** created (`supabase_seed_data.sql`):
  - All 39 exercises from user's CSV program
  - Exercise variations with YouTube tutorial URLs
  - 3-day program structure (Full Body A/B/C)

### ✅ Core Service Layer
- **SupabaseService** with comprehensive functionality:
  - Authentication methods (email/password, anonymous, sign out)
  - User profile management with preferences
  - Exercise and program data retrieval
  - Workout session and set tracking
  - Intelligent progression calculation algorithms
  - Dashboard statistics generation
  - Last set caching for performance

### ✅ UI/Navigation Updates
- **Updated main.dart** to use AuthWrapper as entry point
- **Enhanced HomeScreen** with profile button access
- **Migrated ProgramsScreen** to use Supabase data instead of mock data
- **Proper routing** for all authentication and profile screens
- **Loading states** and error handling throughout the app

### ✅ Data Models Enhancement
- **Complete workout models** migrated from Next.js TypeScript to Dart
- **Progression system** with difficulty-based weight/rep suggestions
- **Cache models** for offline performance and previous workout data

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 🔥 Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Complete Supabase Database Setup**
   - Run `supabase_schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Run `supabase_seed_data.sql` to populate exercise data
   - Verify all tables and data are created correctly

2. **Add Google OAuth Authentication**
   - Configure Google OAuth in Supabase Auth settings
   - Add `google_sign_in` Flutter package
   - Implement Google sign-in button and flow in AuthScreen
   - Test Google authentication flow

3. **Migrate Workout Screens to Supabase**
   - Update WorkoutScreen to use SupabaseService instead of local storage
   - Update ExerciseSelector to load/save workout data via Supabase
   - Implement real-time progression suggestions using database cache
   - Test complete workout flow with database integration

### 📋 Short Term
4. **Offline/Online Sync Capabilities**
   - Implement offline detection and handling
   - Cache workout data locally when offline
   - Sync cached data when connection restored
   - Handle conflict resolution for offline changes

5. **Mobile Testing and Optimization**
   - Test app on physical device
   - Optimize UI for different screen sizes
   - Performance testing and optimization
   - Memory usage optimization

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
6. **Advanced Features**
   - Export workout data (CSV, PDF)
   - Workout history and analytics
   - Progress photos integration
   - Social sharing capabilities

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Frontend**: Flutter 3.5.4
- Material Design 3 UI components
- SharedPreferences for local caching
- State management with StatefulWidget
- Real-time UI updates

### **Backend**: Supabase
- PostgreSQL database with RLS security
- Real-time subscriptions
- Authentication with email/password and OAuth
- Row-level security for data protection

### **Key Files**
- `lib/services/supabase_service.dart`: Complete database service layer
- `lib/screens/auth_*.dart`: Authentication UI and logic
- `lib/models/workout_models.dart`: Data models and progression algorithms
- `supabase_schema.sql`: Database schema with security policies
- `supabase_seed_data.sql`: Exercise data and program structure

## 📊 Current Status

**✅ Completed**: Authentication system, database design, service layer, UI foundation
**🔄 In Progress**: Database setup and Google OAuth integration
**⏳ Next**: Complete Supabase integration and mobile testing
